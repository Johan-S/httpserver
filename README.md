A simple httpserver framework for creating webapps. It uses some of my [utility](https://github.com/Johan-S/util) classes. An example webapp can be found [here](https://github.com/Johan-S/webapp) and it can be viewed live [here](https://mighty-everglades-1636.herokuapp.com/).

Note: These projects are just for fun and should not be used in any production environment!!!
